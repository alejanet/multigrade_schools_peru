# Rural Multigrade Schools Map
This repository includes all the code used for the visualization of Peruvian provinces and regions by the number of rural multigrade schools. I used `spmap`, an Stata package suited for drawing thematic maps. 

The graphs reveal that Cajamarca, in the north of Peru, has one of the largest population of rural multigrade schools and it is where [CREER](https://www.grade.org.pe/creer/) intervene in Phase II.
