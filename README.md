# Rural Multigrade Schools Map
This repository includes all the code used for the visualization of maps by different Peruvian provinces and regions. I used spmap, an Stata package suited for drawing thematic maps following the number of rural multigrade schools around the country. 

The graphs reveal that Cajamarca, in the north of Peru, has the largest population of rural multigrade schools and it is where [CREER](https://www.grade.org.pe/creer/) intervene in Phase II.
